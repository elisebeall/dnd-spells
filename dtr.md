# Work Times
- Slack is best form of communication.  Group message.
- Brian is busy on Mondays & Thursdays
- Auggie is busy on Sunday evenings after 5:30pm
- Elise has to pick up her son on Mondays & Fridays @ 3:30pm

# Workflow
- Context API learning is done together until we have enough of a grasp to divide & conquer
- POMs: 45-50 minutes on / 10 minutes off

# Code Etiquette
- Comments will be used during bug fixes and refactoring, but will be removed before
a branch is merged with main.
- Semi-colons will be used consistently.
- Will use initials at the start of branch names, to differentiate between similarly named branches.
(i.e. feature/eb-bug-fix)
