## Abstract
Squizard's Spells is an app that allows its users to filter through Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition spells and save those spells in a personal spellbook. Spells saved will persist on page load as well. When a user reaches the site, they will be able to look at their personal spellbook or browse spells. Then they can choose the character class that they are playing to narrow it down to spells that that class can use. Players can then click on spells to get the full details or bookmark them to save them to their spellbook.
